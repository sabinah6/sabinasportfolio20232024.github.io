      <p> My name is Sabina Hussain and I'm a senior at Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical Education High School. My CTE class is Devops and Project Management 12 and we are currently learning jQuery and Javascript. Some soft skills I possess are leadership, communication, dependability, time management, etc. I've worked at MG4Tech and learned how to design websites on Wix collaboratively and creatively. I've also worked for Allergic to Salad, where I demonstrated my skills of eficiency and the ability to work at a fast-paced environment by assisting a cooking instructor and her students. </p>
